## Weekend To-Do List

## Description
This is my weekend project for Week 3 onsite at Prime Digital Academy. It's a to-do list where new tasks can be added and existing tasks can be marked complete or deleted. The styling is intentionally strange and not user-friendly. I was experimenting with new things.

## Technologies Used
- Javascript
- jQuery
- Node.js
- Postgres

## Future Plans
The styling was intentionally made with this horrible, unfriendly aesthetic. I will make the styling less ugly and hard-to-use, add the ability to have more than one to-do list, and dry the code out more.

Thanks to everyone at Prime for being there to support me and help me grow as a programmer and as a person.
